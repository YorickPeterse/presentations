# Parsing For Humans

A presentation that introduces the basics of lexing/parsing data using Ragel
and Racc. This talk was given at Amsterdam.rb on May 20th, 2014.

The file `slides.md` contains a description for each slide. The file `ideas.md`
is a raw file with various ideas and what not that I used to write the first
file.
